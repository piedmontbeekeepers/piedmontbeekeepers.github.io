# Piedmont Beekeepers Association

We are one of the oldest beekeeping organizations in South Carolina. A group of local beekeepers who meet once a month to encourage: better methods among beekeepers of the county of Greenville; to promote cooperation; to reach a common understanding regarding our problems and their solutions; to foster a closer cooperation among members of the association; and to do such things as will tend to improve purposes exclusively for its members and the general public relating to honey bees and the beekeeping industry.
